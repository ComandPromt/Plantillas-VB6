Tip 165: Locating CD-ROM Drives Installed on a Computer System
December 5, 1995

Abstract
In a Microsoft® Visual Basic® application, you may need to determine what types of disk drives are installed on a computer system. This article explains how to locate the CD-ROM drives that are installed.

Using the GetDriveType Function
Occasionally, in a Microsoft® Visual Basic® application you may need to determine whether a specific disk drive is a CD-ROM, removable, fixed, RAM, or network drive. You can easily make this distinction by using the Microsoft Windows® application programming interface (API) GetDriveType function.

The following Declare statement should be included in your project:

Private Declare Function GetDriveType Lib "kernel32" Alias "GetDriveTypeA" 
   (ByVal nDrive As String) As Long

To use the GetDriveType function, you need to tell it the name of the disk's root directory. This should be in the format "c:\". After you call it, the GetDriveType function returns a value that indicates the type of disk drive.

The value returned by the GetDriveType function may be one of the following:

Value Drive Type 
0 Unknown media type 
1 No such root directory exists 
DRIVE_REMOVABLE Drive can be removed 
DRIVE_FIXED Drive cannot be removed 
DRIVE_REMOTE Network disk drive 
DRIVE_CDROM CD-ROM disk drive 
DRIVE_RAMDISK RAM disk drive 

As you know, all disk drives are identified by an alphabetic letter, starting with the letter A. The ASCII value for the letter A is 65. Because there are 26 possible disk drives, you can use a For-Next loop to test each possible disk drive to determine whether it is a CD-ROM disk drive.

Example Program
This program shows how to locate all CD-ROM disk drives installed on the computer system. 

Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. 
Add the following Declare statement to the General Declarations section of Form1 (note that the Declare statement must be typed as a single line of code): 
Private Declare Function GetDriveType Lib "kernel32" Alias "GetDriveTypeA" 
   (ByVal nDrive As String) As Long

Add a Command Button control to Form1. Command1 is created by default. 
Add the following code to the Click event for Command1: 
Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Text1.Text = FindCDROM
End Sub

Add a Text Box control to form1. Text1 is created by default. Set its MultiLine property to True. 
Create a new function called FindCDROM. Add the following code to this function: 
Function FindCDROM() As String
    Dim Drive As Integer
    Const DRIVE_CDROM = 5
    FindCDROM = "No CD_ROM Installed"

    For Drive = 65 To 90
        If GetDriveType(Chr(Drive) & ":\") = DRIVE_CDROM Then
            FindCDROM = "CD-ROM Drive " & Chr(Drive) & ":\"
            Exit For
        End If
    Next Drive
End Function

Run the example program by pressing F5. Click the Command Button control. A list of all CD-ROM disk drives installed on the computer system appears in the Text Box control.
