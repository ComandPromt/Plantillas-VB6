The following sample code takes a text file from the local hard drive on the client and appends it to the current DHTML page: 

Start a new Visual Basic project and select DHTML Application. 
Open DHTMLPage1 under Designers (Project Explorer). 
Add a TextField to the page, and set its value property to nothing. 
Add a Button to the page, and set its value property to "Add File." 
In the Properties window, select DispIHTMLBodyElement, and set its Id property to "test." 
For the Button1_OnClick event, add the following code:

      Private Function Button1_onclick() As Boolean

      Dim f As Integer            ' File Handle
      Dim txt As String           ' Holds text of file for
                                  ' processing
      Dim strLoc As Long          ' Holds current location for
                                  ' INSTR

      f = FreeFile

      If Len(Dir$(TextField1.Value)) > 0 Then
         Open TextField1.Value For Input As #f
             txt = Input$(LOF(f), f)
         Close #f
        else
         test.innerHTML = test.innerHTML & "<BR><BR>File Not Found."
         Exit Function
      End If

      ' Convert CR/LF to HTML line break (<BR>) tags.

      strLoc = InStr(txt, vbCrLf)

      Do While strLoc <> 0
         txt = Mid$(txt, 1, (strLoc - 1)) & "<BR>" _
            & Mid$(txt, strLoc + 2)
         strLoc = InStr(strLoc + 1, txt, vbCrLf)
      Loop

      ' Add Contents of Text file to end of DHTML page.

      test.innerHTML = test.innerHTML & "<BR><BR>" & txt

      End Function

						


Run the code and type the name of a text file in the text box.
