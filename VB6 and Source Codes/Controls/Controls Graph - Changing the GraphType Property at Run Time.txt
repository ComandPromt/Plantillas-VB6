Tip 19: Changing the GraphType Property at Run Time
Created: March 1, 1995

When using the Graph custom control in a Visual Basic® application, you can change the GraphType property at run time.

To change the GraphType property successfully in an application, you must first execute a DrawMode statement, and then execute the statement that changes the GraphMode property. Therefore, you would first call the following statement in your Visual Basic application:

Graph1.GraphType = 1

Then, immediately after executing this statement, you would include the statement to change the GraphMode property, as follows:

Graph1.DrawMode = 2 (or 3).
