Container Property Example
This example demonstrates moving a CommandButton control from container to container on a Form object. To try this example, paste the code into the Declarations section of a form that contains a Frame control, a PictureBox control and a CommandButton, and then press F5.

Private Sub Form_Click()
   Static intX As Integer
   Select Case intX
      Case 0
         Set Command1.Container = Picture1
         Command1.Top= 0
         Command1.Left= 0
      Case 1
         Set Command1.Container = Frame1
         Command1.Top= 0
         Command1.Left= 0
      Case 2
         Set Command1.Container = Form1
         Command1.Top= 0
         Command1.Left= 0
   End Select
   intX = intX + 1
End Sub
