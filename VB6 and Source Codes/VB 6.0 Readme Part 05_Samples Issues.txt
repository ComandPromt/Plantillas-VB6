MORE INFORMATION
Sample File Locations
If you choose to include Visual Basic samples in your MSDN setup, they are installed to the directory: 

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
   Studio\MSDN98\98VS\1033\Samples\VB98.
				

If you choose not to include the Visual Basic samples in your MSDN setup, you can find the Visual Basic samples on the MSDN CD at: 

   D:\Samples\Vb98
				

NOTE: The drive letters mentioned above may vary on your system. 

Visual Basic Sample: Biblio and Mouse Samples Omitted
The Biblio sample program, found in the Visual Basic documentation table of contents, is no longer included with the Visual Basic product. The Mouse sample, mentioned in "Responding to Mouse and Keyboard Events" is also no longer included with the product. 

Visual Basic Samples: ChrtSamp Description
ChrtSamp is a new sample program included with Visual Basic that demonstrates the major features of the MSChart control. If you have installed the Visual Basic samples, the sample can be found in the following location on your hard disk: 

   \\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
   Studio\Msdn98\98vs\1033\Samples\Vb98\ChrtSamp
				

If you have not installed the Visual Basic samples on your hard disk, the sample can be found on the MSDN CD at the following location: 

   Samples\Vb98\ChrtSamp
				

The sample uses an Excel spreadsheet to supply data for a chart. The sample also allows you to display multi-series charts by clicking various buttons. Finally, the sample demonstrates 3D features of the control by setting the ChartType property to an appropriate value. 

     File              Description
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     Chrtsamp.vbp    The project file for the sample.

     Frmchart.frm    The main form for the sample.

     Frmchart.frx    Binary data for the form.

     Gas.xls         The Excel worksheet containing the data.

     Modchart.bas    Code module containing functions and procedures
                     for the sample.
				


To Run
Press F5 to run the sample. After all data has loaded, click on the "Chart Type" to change the type. To see the three-dimensional features of the sample, click the Chart Type combo box and select a 3-D chart type, such as 3dArea. While holding down the CTRL key, right-click the chart, and use the cursor to change the aspect of the chart. 

Visual Basic Samples: CtlsAdd Sample: Controls.mdb Must Be Read/Write 
Enabled on Hard Disk
If you attempt to run the CtlsAdd samples from the MSDN CD, an error will occur if you attempt to use the controls.mdb database found on the CD. Because CtlCfg.vbp sample uses an Access database (controls.mdb) to store license key information about controls, the database must be installed on a hard disk. Copy the controls.mdb file to the hard disk and make it writable. 

DHSHOWME.VBP Sample: You May Need to Reset the SourceFile Property For This 
Sample to Work Correctly in Design Mode
If your Page Designer samples appear blank when you open them in design mode, please reset the SourceFile property to reflect the location on your computer to which the project's HTML files were installed. You must reset this property for each designer in the project. Your sample should then work correctly. 

To reset the SourceFile property for a designer, either type a path directly into the SourceFile property in the Properties window, or select the Project Properties icon from the toolbox, click Save as an External File, then click Open and navigate to the correct .htm file. 

PROPBAG.VBP Sample: Possible Error on Loading the Module for this Sample
Propbag.vbp references a module (Module1.bas) that is located in the default installation directory for MSDN samples. If you move this sample to another directory, you will receive an error when you open the project that the module path is incorrect. To fix this, load the project without the module, then re-add the module from the directory to which you installed your samples. 

Running the IObjSafe Sample Application
Due to some late-breaking changes, the IObjSafe sample application (IObjSafe.vbp) will not run properly unless you first make the following modifications: 

Load the IObjSafe.vbp project file into the development environment. 

Choose ucObjSafety Properties from the Project menu. On the Debugging tab, delete the path and file name from the Start program text box. 

Type the actual path and file name for IObjSafe.htm in the Start browser with URL text box. The actual path may vary depending on your installation. 

Choose Options from the Tools menu. On the General tab, choose the Break on Unhandled Errors option button. 

The application should now run properly. 

An updated version of the IObjSafe sample application is available online at the Microsoft Visual Basic samples page. 

Obtaining Updated Versions of Sample Applications
Updated versions of many of the Visual Basic sample applications, as well as additional samples not included on the CD, are available online at the Microsoft Visual Basic samples page.
