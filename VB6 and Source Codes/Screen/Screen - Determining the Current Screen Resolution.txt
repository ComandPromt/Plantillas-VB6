Tip 175: Determining the Current Screen Resolution

Abstract
This article explains how to determine the current screen resolution in a Microsoft® Visual Basic® application.

Determining Horizontal and Vertical Screen Resolutions
When developing a Microsoft® Visual Basic® application, it may be necessary to determine the current screen resolution. You can do this by retrieving the TwipsPerPixelX and TwipsPerPixelY properties of the Screen object.

To determine the horizontal resolution of the screen, you retrieve the value of the TwipsPerPixelX property. Next, you divide the screen's current Height property by this value.

To determine the vertical resolution of the screen, you retrieve the value of the TwipsPerPixelY property. Next, you divide the screen's current Width property by this value.

Example Program
This program shows how to determine the current screen resolution in a Visual Basic application. 

Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. 
Add a Text Box control to Form1. Text1 is created by default. 
Add a Command Button control to Form1. Command1 is created by default. 
Add the following code to the Click event for Command1: 
Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Dim XTwips As Long
    Dim YTwips As Long
    Dim XPixels As Long
    Dim YPixels As Long

    XTwips = Screen.TwipsPerPixelX
    YTwips = Screen.TwipsPerPixelY

    YPixels = Screen.Height / YTwips
    XPixels = Screen.Width / XTwips

    Text1.Text = Str$(XPixels) + " x " + Str$(YPixels)
End Sub

Run the example program by pressing F5. Click the Command Button control. The current screen resolution appears in the Text Box control.
