Tip 204: Changing the Screen Resolution at Run Time in Visual Basic 4.0
February 28, 1996

Abstract 
Because Microsoft Windows 95 users may have different screen resolution settings, you may need to set the screen resolution to a specific setting while your Microsoft® Visual Basic® version 4.0 application is running. This article explains how to change your screen resolution from within Visual Basic.

Setting the Screen Resolution
Under the Microsoft® Windows® 95 operating system, you can set your screen resolution by running the Display applet in Control Panel. In a Microsoft Visual Basic® version 4.0 application, you can use the Windows application programming interface (API) EnumDisplaySettings and ChangeDisplaySettings functions to change the screen resolution while your program is running.

The EnumDisplaySettings function allows you to retrieve information about your display's graphics modes. This information is then stored in a DEVMODE structure.

After you have interrogated the computer system with the EnumDisplaySettings function, you use the ChangeDisplaySettings function to tell the operating system to use a different screen resolution.

The ChangeDisplaySettings function lets you set the screen resolution to a different graphics mode. The DEVMODE structure holds the graphics mode information to which you want to change.

In the example program below, you first retrieve the current screen resolution information by calling the EnumDisplaySettings function. The DEVMODE structure contains the graphics modes information for the display type. Next, you modify the dmPelsWidth and dmPelsHeight fields in the DEVMODE structure to reflect the new screen resolution you want to set. Finally, you call the ChangeDisplaySettings function to tell the operating system to set the new screen resolution as the default resolution.

Example Program
This program shows how to set the screen resolution from within a Visual Basic application. 

Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. 
Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1 (note that each Declare statement must be typed as a single line of code): 
Option Explicit
Private Declare Function EnumDisplaySettings Lib "user32" Alias 
   "EnumDisplaySettingsA" (ByVal lpszDeviceName As Long, 
   ByVal iModeNum As Long, lpDevMode As Any) As Boolean

Private Declare Function ChangeDisplaySettings Lib "user32" Alias 
   "ChangeDisplaySettingsA" (lpDevMode As Any, ByVal dwflags As Long) As Long

Const CCDEVICENAME = 32
Const CCFORMNAME = 32
Const DM_PELSWIDTH = &H80000
Const DM_PELSHEIGHT = &H100000

Private Type DEVMODE
    dmDeviceName As String * CCDEVICENAME
    dmSpecVersion As Integer
    dmDriverVersion As Integer
    dmSize As Integer
    dmDriverExtra As Integer

    dmFields As Long
    dmOrientation As Integer
    dmPaperSize As Integer
    dmPaperLength As Integer
    dmPaperWidth As Integer
    dmScale As Integer
    dmCopies As Integer
    dmDefaultSource As Integer
    dmPrintQuality As Integer
    dmColor As Integer
    dmDuplex As Integer
    dmYResolution As Integer
    dmTTOption As Integer
    dmCollate As Integer

    dmFormName As String * CCFORMNAME
    dmUnusedPadding As Integer
    dmBitsPerPel As Integer
    dmPelsWidth As Long
    dmPelsHeight As Long
    dmDisplayFlags As Long
    dmDisplayFrequency As Long
End Type
Dim DevM As DEVMODE

Add a Command Button control to Form1. Command1 is created by default. 
Add the following code to the Click event for Command1: 
Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Dim a As Boolean
    Dim i&
    i = 0
    Do
        a = EnumDisplaySettings(0&, i&, DevM)
        i = i + 1
    Loop Until (a = False)
End Sub

Add a second Command Button control to Form1. Command2 is created by default. 
Add the following code to the Click event for Command2: 
Private Sub Command2_Click()
    Dim b&
    DevM.dmFields = DM_PELSWIDTH Or DM_PELSHEIGHT

    DevM.dmPelsWidth = 800
    DevM.dmPelsHeight = 600

    b = ChangeDisplaySettings(DevM, 0)
End Sub

Run the example program by pressing Click the first Command Button control. This retrieves all the graphics modes for your display. Next, click the second Command Button control to change the display's screen resolution to 800 x 600 graphics mode.
