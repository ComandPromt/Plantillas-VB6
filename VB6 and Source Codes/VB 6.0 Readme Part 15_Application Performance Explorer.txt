Configuring Remote Automation Security When Using Remote APE Components
In order to use Remote Automation (RA) to communicate with remote APE components, you may have to configure RA security using the Remote Automation Connection Manager (Racmgr32.exe). 

To configure RA security: 

Start Racmgr32.exe and click the Client Access tab. 
Select either "Allow All Remote Creates" or "Allow Remote Creates by Key". 
If "Allow Remote Creates by Key" is selected, make sure the "Allow Remote Activation" check box is checked for each APE component. 
RA supports the following levels of authentication: 

   Name           Value  Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Default        0      Use Network default.
   None           1      No authentication.
   Connect        2      Connection to the server is authenticated.
   Call           3      Authenticates only at the beginning of each
                         remote procedure call, when the server
                         receives the request. Does not apply to
                         connection-based protocol sequences (those
                         that start with the prefix "ncacn").
   Packet         4      Verifies that all data received is from the
                         expected client.
   Packet         5      Verifies that none of the data transferred
   Integrity             between client and server has been
                         modified.
   Packet Privacy 6      Verifies all other levels and encrypts the
                         argument values of each remote procedure
                         call.
				

APE profiles are initially installed with an authentication level of 1 ("None") because Windows 95 supports only that level of authentication. However, if additional security is desired, the level of authentication of a profile can be changed by modifying the profile collection file (the Aemanagr.ini file) by using a text editor such as Notepad. 

Each profile in the profile collection file begins with the name of the profile within square brackets, such as [Peak performance, synchronous (CPU, Pool)]. The attributes of the profile follow, using the format <name>=<value> (such as "Task Duration=1"). To change the authentication level, change the value of the "Authentication" attribute of the selected profile and save the file. 

Compatibility Issues Between the Application Performance Explorer (APE) that Ships with Visual Studio 6.0 and the Version that Shipped with Visual 

Basic 5.0
There are known compatibility issues between the Application Performance Explorer (APE) that ships with Visual Studio 6.0 and the APE that shipped with Visual Basic 5.0. 

To avoid the compatibility issues, do one of the following: 

Before installing Visual Studio 6.0 and APE on the computer that has the version of APE shipped with VB 5, first uninstall APE from Visual Basic, and then install Visual Studio and APE. 
If you have installed Visual Studio 6.0 and APE on the same computer that has the VB5 APE, uninstall the VB APE and then reinstall the Visual Studio APE. 
Adjusting Default Settings To Use APE and MTS
After installing the APETEST database onto your SQL Server, you must adjust some of the default settings in order to use APE and MTS. 

NOTE: If you haven't already installed the APETEST database on your SQL Server, you should do that first. To learn how to install the APETEST database, search for the topic "APE Database Setup Wizard" in MSDN Library Visual Studio 6.0. 

To configure the APETEST database installation to work with MTS: 

Start Microsoft SQL Enterprise Manager. 
In the Databases folder, right-click the APETEST database and click Edit. 
Click the Options tab. 
Select the Truncated Log on Checkpoint check box and click OK. 
In the Databases folder, right-click the tempdb database and click Edit. 
Click Expand. 
In the Data Device box, select <new>. 
In the New Database Device dialog box, in the Name box, type tempdbData. 
In the Size (MB) box, type 10. 
Click Create Now, and finally click OK. 
Click Expand Now. 
Click Expand. 
In the Log Device box, select <new>. 
In the New Database Device dialog box, in the Name box, type tempdbLog. 
In the Size (MB) box, type 10. 
Click Create Now, and finally click OK. 
To configure the allowable number of user connections: 

Start Microsoft SQL Enterprise Manager. 
Right-click the server and click Configure. 
For example, if your server is named CORONA, in the Server Manager child window, right-click CORONA and then click Configure. 
Click the Configuration tab. 
In the Configuration box, increase the number of user connections by at least 15. 

NOTE: If you are running APETEST on an established production database server, you may not have access permission to adjust the current number of user connections. In this case, you should ask your database administrator to increase the number of current user connections by at least 15 connections to support APE testing. 

Application Performance Explorer Server-Side Setup May Generate Error
While installing the APE server-side components, you may see an error referring to an incorrect version of OLEAUT32.dll. You may dismiss this error and continue with the installation. 

However, this error message may indicate that the Microsoft Transaction Server Package was not installed correctly. To confirm that it was installed correctly, run the Transaction Server Explorer and look for all installed MTS packages on your computer. Visual Studio APE Package should be listed. 

To install the package, AEMTSSVC.pkg, run the MTS Transaction Server Explorer from the Start menu and install the package to the local computer using the MTS Explorer.
