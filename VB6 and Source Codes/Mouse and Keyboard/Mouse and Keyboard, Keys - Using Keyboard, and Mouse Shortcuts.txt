Using Undocumented Keyboard and Mouse Techniques
When you are in the Microsoft® Visual Basic® code window, you can click in the left margin of the window to select a specific line, or you can double-click in the left margin to select an entire function or procedure. Similarly, you can press the CTRL key while clicking in the left margin to select all functions. 
When designing an application, you can move a control's position within the form up, down, left, or right by holding down CTRL while pressing the appropriate arrow key. 
When designing an application, you can manually adjust the size of a control by one pixel by holding down the SHIFT key while pressing the appropriate arrow key. 
In the code window, pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F2 moves the cursor back to its previous location. 
A context-sensitive menu is displayed for the toolbar, toolbox, form, control, code window, debug window, and project window when you right-click that object.
