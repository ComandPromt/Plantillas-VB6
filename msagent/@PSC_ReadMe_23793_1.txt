Title: Complete Desktop Annoyance(Buddy) - MSAgent
Description: Ever want a complete little annoying desktop guy you can have him say anything you would like. Well here it is. A complete desktop buddy program I made for fun. Gives you ability to have a 'your sayings' list plus it comes with a bunch of other sayings -> facts, jokes etc. I used .lst for the sayings list so be sure to put those into the program directory : "C:\Program Files\DesktopAnnoyance".  You can edit .lst with notepad and change any of those sayings to accomidate your needs. Will be making a later version that uses a .mdb instead of .lst. You will also need to download microsoft's msagents text to speech engine, core components and merlin for the starting character. the address is: "http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/imedia/agent/agentdl.asp" You can get a bunch of free characters on the web. I tried to put alot of notes but I don't have alot of time. When compiled the program is only about 1 mb. Enjoy and don't forget to vote if you enjoy it.
