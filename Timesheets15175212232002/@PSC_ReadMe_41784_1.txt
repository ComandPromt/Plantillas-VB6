Title: Timesheets Lite
Description: Timesheets Lite is a piece of software written for companies that cost their employees time on an hourly basis. This could include accountancy firms, consultants, or contractors. It enables companies to create projects in the software, create employees in the software, and then allow those employees to book their time against the projects. Members of the financial team at the company can then generate a report showing the time spent by employees on projects for a given time frame, and mark this range of times as invoiced.
