Rs-Thumbnail-list-control
************************

Purpose:

Thumbnail view from a list of pictures files in certain directory. Very simular to the welknown program "ACDSee".  
The creation of a webpage(s) Master(index with thumbs)- Detail(full picture size), with links to the next or previous page.  

Rs-Thumbnaillist control is not compiled to ActiveX control(OCX). You can use this control in the controls "private mode" directly into your own project. However.... as you know the control can be set to the "Public mode" compiled to an "OCX". I prefer embedded controls without dependencies to a lot of rubbish in  the system directory. In my case just the standard vbruntime modules will be enough to run the program with advanced possibility's in itself. "Rs-Thumbnaillist control" is a very robust control control with a lot of options.  It can handle a huge amount of pictures.... how ever... keep in mind that the every thing is working in VB and not c++.
