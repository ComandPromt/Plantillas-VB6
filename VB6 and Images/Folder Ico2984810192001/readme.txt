This program is meant for changing folder icons. You can change almost any folder icon, including folders on net and floppy disks.

Note that program does it by editing (or creating) desktop.ini file, and it also sets folder as system folder in order to display icons correctly. This program for now won't change Recycled, MyDocuments, Favorites and similar Windows system folder icons. Maybe next version will. 

Enjoy the program. I hope it will make your life a bit more colourful :).

And if you like it, give me a 5 on PSC ;). Any suggestions, constructive criticism, found bugs are also welcome.

Best regards,
