***** Kath-Rock Image Viewer w/source code *****

A great application for viewing entire folders of images. No limit to the number of images in the folder. Much better than a thumbnail viewer, this program shows each image at full size in a tab style design. Add and delete tabs for quick reference between images. This code also demonstrates the use of system ImageLists in a ListView. Features OLE drag and drop from Explorer. As an added bonus this application comes with the KRScroll scroll bar OCX (Sorry, no source code for the Kath-Rock KRScroll, but you can use it in your own apps, no license required).

***** IMPORTANT *****
You must register the KRScroll.ocx before opening this code in VB. Otherwise you'll get the dreaded "Component not found" error and an error log file and the scroll bars will be converted to PictureBoxes.

To register the component:
(1) Click the "Start" button and select "Run".
(2) In the run dialog box, type [RegSvr32 "<OCX path>\KRSCroll.ocx"], where <OCX path> is the path to where the ocx resides on your computer. DO NOT type the brackets [].
(3) Click OK. You should get a message telling you that the ocx registered successfully.
