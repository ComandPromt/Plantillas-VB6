' A little info...
' Objects in the shell’s namespace are assigned item identifiers and item
' identifier lists. An item identifier uniquely identifies an item within its parent
' folder. An item identifier list uniquely identifies an item within the shell’s
' namespace by tracing a path to the item from the desktop.

'///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

' An item identifier is defined by the variable-length SHITEMID structure.
' The first two bytes of this structure specify its size, and the format of
' the remaining bytes depends on the parent folder, or more precisely
' on the software that implements the parent folder’s IShellFolder interface.
' Except for the first two bytes, item identifiers are not strictly defined, and
' applications should make no assumptions about their format.

    abID() As Byte  ' The item ID (variable length)
End Type

' The ITEMIDLIST structure defines an element in an item identifier list
' (the only member of this structure is an SHITEMID structure). An item
' identifier list consists of one or more consecutive ITEMIDLIST structures
' packed on byte boundaries, followed by a 16-bit zero value. An application
' can walk a list of item identifiers by examining the size specified in each
' SHITEMID structure and stopping when it finds a size of zero. A pointer
' to an item identifier list, is sometimes called a PIDL (pronounced piddle)
Type ITEMIDLIST   ' idl
