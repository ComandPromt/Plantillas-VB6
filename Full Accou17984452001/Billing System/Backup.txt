app.path & "\Recent Invoices\"
save each invoice to this folder as "invoice#.rtf"
each time frmInvoice is opened to view the invoice, automatically save it to dir
use a feature where u type in the invoice number into a textbox and it checks to see if
  the file exists (text1.text & ".rtf"),  if it does, it loads the file into frmInvoice
  otherwise an error comes up with a msgbox saying it cannot find the file.
