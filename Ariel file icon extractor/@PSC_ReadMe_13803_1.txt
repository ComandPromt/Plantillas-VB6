Title: Ariel file icon extractor
Description: This project demonstrates how to extract large and small icons associated with files into an imagelist and displaying them in a listview with
the filenames. The SHGetFileInfo function of the shell32.dll library is used, which makes the job much easier than before. The ImageList_Draw
function in comctl32.dll is used to draw the icon in a picture box,from where it is placed into the image list. Other submissions on PSC do an OK job on large icons, but the small icons are a mess. Not here! Credits to Peter Meier for his DelRecent posting.
