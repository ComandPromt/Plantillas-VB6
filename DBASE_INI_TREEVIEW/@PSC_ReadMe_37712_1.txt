Title: DBASE_INI_TREEVIEW
Description: Allows a User to create SubNodes in a treeview control that directly interfaces with the database loaded into the treeview control.
Treeview will have main NODE of Database.. Then Categories for the tables in your database will be loaded from the INI file..the Corresponding tables will be placed under the Categories and then The Subnodes of the Categories with the SQL statements to display certain things when the subnodes are clicked will be loaded into the treeview Under the tables in the Categories..A little confusing... The Tables from the databases are Sorted to Categorys by the Number in front of the table name. So if a table was named 1Table it would be sorted into category 1. Thus 2Table would be into Category 2. The Tables in the same Categorys must have the same fields though for the displaying of records correctly when one of the subnodes is clicked. That is the best i can explain it. Im sorry if anyone does not understand.
