Title: IBM Client Access Object Wrapper
Description: Generates a DSN-less connection string and allows easy log on to an IBM AS/400 box. Uses the Client Access API to validate server & log-on details. 
Set properties in a single exposed class, connect to multiple libraries etc (Obviously, you need Client Access installed and an AS/400 box to connect to...!!!). A single ADO connection object is returned from the CClientAccess class if logon success.
Some code in the CCALogOn class is a hack from original IBM source...copyrights apply yada yada yada.
