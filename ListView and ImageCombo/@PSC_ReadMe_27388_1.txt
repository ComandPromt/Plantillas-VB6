Title: ImageCombo/Listview
Description: I needed a file open dialog that I could put on a form.This is what I came up with. The GetSysIcon is from someone else I can't remember who.
Known Bugs: Will not get Icon for files with numeric extentions(*.001) and will not list any files after encountering this extension. Interface does strange things when opening a large directory such as windows. If you have any suggestions or comments please contact me.
