Title: Network Enumerator
Description: A self-contained class that provides a simple method of getting a list of all the computers on all the networks visible from the machine running the code. It also provides a list of the domains, printers, shares, network names, server names - basically everything you can get out of the WNet API. 
PLEASE NOTE: (Before anyone flames me for plagiarism) 
This code has been adapted from several snippets that I have found on my travels. Credit is due to AGP for pointing me in the right direction, and also Mr.X from Google Groups for supplying some code for me to base my class upon.
I hope this condensed version helps someone out.
