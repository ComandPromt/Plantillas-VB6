This program is not yet Complete. There are a few bugs and I would be extreamly gratefull if you could point them out to me, should u find them, as i'm hoping to EVENTUALLY release this as a full program.

Future updates to this program will include: Allowing both the remote computers and the connected computers mice to work independantly. The ability to send Keystrokes.. Better JPG Quality with smaller Image filesize. Faster transfers and a 'Chat' feature... More to follow...
