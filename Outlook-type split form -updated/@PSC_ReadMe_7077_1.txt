Title: Vertical splitter/Outlook-type split form -updated
Description: This form contains an example of how to do a simple Outlook-type split form. The splitter code is modifed from the http://www.vb-helper.com/HowTo/hsplit.zip code. I have updated to include icons and labels under each button. The project is now only compatible with VB6 as I am using a resource file to store the icons. I have found and fixed the problem with icons not disappearing when the form is resized and also implemented scrolling to allow users to see obscured icons.
