cTREEVIEW Class Wrapper v1.0.3 with ADO Code Example
====================================================

New features - Now cTREEVIEW class has 28 features! 

New cTREEVIEW Features include: Flat border; IsChildNode; CopyNode with cancel option; Cut Icon state. ADO Example now supports: New Nodes/Records can be added; copy treeview node(s); Cut/Copy/Paste through right-click context menu; and functions are now benchmarked with results displayed.

cTREEVIEW class fixes: If the destination or source node was not expanded during a Move operation, an error was raised - only happens if nodes are loaded on-demand.

ADO Example fixes: Adjusted pExpandNode to handle group nodes without hidden nodes.

A special thanks to Zhu Jinyong for his suggestions for the ADO Example including CopyNode, Cut/Copy/Paste plus finding the Exand Node error.



cTREEVIEW Class Wrapper v1.0.2 with ADO Code Example
====================================================

New ADO example added now supporting: Load on demand; Find First/ Next/ Previous; Label Edit; Drag'n'Drop; Node & TreeView context menus; node specific Open/Closed/Drag icons. New cTREEVIEW class features: Scroll treeview Up/ Down/ PageUp/ PageDown/ Home/ End using code; Dragging with auto-scrolling (not supported by Microsoft in the TreeView control); NodeFirstViewable; & NodeLastViewable. 

ADO Example fixes: Find Next/Previous didn't work if branches already loaded. cTREEVIEW class fixes: correct node drag icon displayed.

Original features include: fast clear a treeview; extended Add/Rename/Delete nodes; move nodes through code &/or Drag'n'Drop including parent nodes onto child nodes (not normally possible!); find node using text and (optionally) key properties; check if a node is a parent of another; checks if a node is a root node; a safe get parent node text; right-click context menu (before/after click event); collapse/expand all nodes; collape/expand all child nodes; enable/disable redraw.

This example shows how to:- work with multiple tables of data and load data on demand. As a bonus, I've included cDB class that encapsulates working with an Access Database using ADO. All code is heavily commented.

If there are any routines that you feel are missing or code/bug-fixes that you wish to contribute, then please let me know and I'll add them in.



cTREEVIEW Class Wrapper - First of its kind!
============================================

The Internet is a place of vast knowledge. But when it can time to find help with the TreeView control for a project that I was working on, very little information could be found.

This is the first of two uploads (second example to follow in the near future with ADO code) that will show how to fast clear a treeview; extended Add/Rename/Delete nodes; move nodes through code &/or Drag'n'Drop including parent nodes onto child nodes (not normally possible!); find node using text and (optionally) key properties; check if a node is a parent of another; checks if a node is a root node; a safe get parent node text; right-click context menu (before/after click event); collapse/expand all nodes; collape/expand all child nodes; enable/disable redraw.

All 16 TreeView features are wrapped into a simple to use class that can be added into any project. A sample program shows how to use all of the class wrapper routines plus all code is heavily documented. Help/tips has also been added for VB's Object Browser.

If there are any routines that you feel are missing or code/bug-fixes that you wish to contribute, then please let me know and I'll add them in.
