Title: Xplorer 3
Description: The webbrowser is back better than ever! An all-new GUI! The same features are retained, and a cool new progress bar was added! For those new to this, it has all of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5's features, though in a tiny package...
There are a couple of bugs, though. If you run into problems, send me an e-mail @: panself1@juno.com
