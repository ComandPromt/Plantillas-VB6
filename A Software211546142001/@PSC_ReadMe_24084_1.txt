Title: A Software Inventory Database App
Description: Very simple application that stores information about software. Stores Title,Serial#/CD-Key, Company/Author. Most significant thing is the use of DAO 3.6 to manipulate the database and write the report for printing. Code is commented, and clean. Limited error-checking and input checking. I do not plan on doing much more with this program, other than use it to keep a list of my own software. Please give me comments, votes NOT needed or requested.
