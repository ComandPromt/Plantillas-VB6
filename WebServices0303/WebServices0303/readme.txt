House of Web Services: Accessing Raw SOAP Messages in an ASP.NET Web Service

To run this UNSUPPORTED sample...

1) Unzip the code into a directory
2) Open the solution file in Visual Studio .NET
3) Build the solution
4) Set an IIS virtual root to point to the Server subdirectory
5) Step through the client in the debugger

Note:

If you want to rebuild the proxy code, point wsdl.exe or the Add Web Reference
dialog to the static server.wsdl file, as the server's support for dynamic WSDL
generation has been disabled via web.config.
