Title: Bobo Pad
Description: Advanced Find/Replace. Unlimited Undo/Redo. UPDATED - some minor bugs removed. Demonstrates getting file properties, obtaining document statistics, page setup, printing, file association, create shortcuts, date format, advanced selection options, wordwrap, using commondialog without MS control, controlling RichTextBox scrolling. Can open/save .rtf, .doc and any plain text. Includes a heavily modified version of Undo/Redo classes by Sebastian Thomschke - fully optimized for speed when handling large files. There are many examples of plain text editors here on PSC. I would not have submitted this upload unless I thought it was a significant improvement upon existing submissions.
This one is definately better than Notepad. Having submitted 
Bobo RegEdit(RegEdit.exe replacement), and Bobo Image Workshop(more than a Paint replacement), I thought I might as well upload this. Behaves just like Notepad without filesize restrictions (Rich Text Box) but edits entirely in plain text format.
Thankyou all for reporting the bugs you found - zip file updated minus those bugs.
