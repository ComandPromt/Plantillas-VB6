Title: API System Monitor
Description: compact system monitor that monitors CPU usage (%), total free memory (%), and free physical memory (in MB and %) with API (NO DLL's). Also includes code for efficient "progress bars" that don't flicker, code to find the windows directory, make programs automatically run on startup, put your program on top of all, and use the registry to it's full extent. **Fixed bugs in drawing the blue and red bars!**AND it doesn't overwrite windows' sysmon.exe anymore (oops)**
