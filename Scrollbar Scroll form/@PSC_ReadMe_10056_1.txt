Title: Interesting way to use the scrollbar
Description: This small app quickly shows you how to use a scrollbar in your app. Most examples on this site show you how to use the scrollbar with a picturebox. I take a different approach by applying the scrollbar to controls in general. Instead of scrolling the contents of the control, I scroll the control itself. Example included points to the Northwind DB, but you could apply it to any. Use this idea to put a large amount of controls in a small area.
